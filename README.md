# ❄️ FrostNet – Deep Learning for Cryogenic Temperature Anomaly Detection

**FrostNet** is a time-series anomaly detection project focused on monitoring and analyzing **cryogenic temperatures**—typically temperatures below -150°C. This system is particularly relevant for applications in scientific research, industrial storage, space engineering, and superconductor technologies, where maintaining temperature stability is crucial.

Using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model, FrostNet is capable of learning patterns from historical data and identifying subtle anomalies that could signal faults, system failures, or unexpected behavior in a cryogenic environment.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Generate synthetic cryogenic temperature data that simulates real-world sensor behavior.
- Preprocess and normalize the data for deep learning workflows.
- Train an LSTM-based neural network for time-series modeling and anomaly detection.
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, MAE, and RMSE.
- Visualize temperature fluctuations and detected anomalies to gain actionable insights.
